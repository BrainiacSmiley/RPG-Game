A place to play with things I always wanted to try:

- Sockets
- Tiled Maps
- MMO Related Stuff
- HTML5 Canvas


Working:
- Client connects to Server
- All communication between Client and Server per Sockets
- Client gets Map from Server
- Draggable Map
- Character movable with Arrow and (W,A,S,D)

Buggy:
- The tile auto Edit. Just started to add it.
- Missing tiles for certain tile combinations.
